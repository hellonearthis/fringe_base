Follow Detective Frank Holloway as he navigates a world without peril as you witness what a hero does once his story finishes. Moving on perhaps comes easier to some than others. \n\n \n\nThe Last Crime is a passion project of style, comedy and maybe even a smidgen of meaning. It was born out of a scene concept in 2023 which, while performed, was brimming with unrealised potential. The original script that inspired The Last Crime was a small parody scene fished from a hidden corner of the internet simply titled 'Film Noir'. It was performed as part of a Theatre Directing course at Victoria University that due to a combination of factors, didn't live up to the imagery and humour envisioned. The Last Crime is a channel through which ideas, goals and visions born of that original scene might finally be realised. \n\n \n\nThe Last Crime promises to be an engaging and entertaining performance of familiar Film Noir tropes such as the femme fatale, staggering amounts of booze and ominous chalk outlines. While the original Film Noir script was entirely a comedy, The Last Crime introduces an existential weight behind the comical punches of the story. Themes of change, resisting it and the destructive outcome of doing so are prominent features of our play and are just as important as the gags. \n\n \n\nWhich is dirtier, the city, or the people who call it home?

This unique festival explores the shared struggles of colonisation between Palestine and Aotearoa, using windows as a metaphor for witnessing history and endurance. Each day offers a new perspective, inviting the audience to engage deeply with themes of displacement, resilience, and cultural expression.\n\nThe first day features Sameh Shamout's solo performance, Window of Palestine, where poetry, music, and architecture are intricately woven together. Through storytelling, Sameh builds cities from wooden blocks--delicate yet powerful symbols of his people's history. His trembling hands reflect the emotional weight of the narrative, yet the structures stand tall, representing the steadfastness of those he honors. Inevitably, the blocks collapse, mirroring the fragility imposed by colonisation. This visual metaphor poignantly captures the vulnerability of colonised lands and their people.\n\nOn the second day, guest poets will take on the role of \"colonised windows,\" each offering a poetic reflection on their experiences with colonisation. Their words act as windows into different stories, opening vistas into the pain, survival, and enduring spirit of cultures across time.\n\nThe third day blends Māori and Palestinian voices, as Windows Singing their pain and whispers fills the space with a fusion of traditional songs. These two distant yet connected cultures merge in a powerful expression of grief, resilience, and hope through their respective musical traditions.\n\nOn the fourth day, the festival culminates in an interactive, living art performance. The audience becomes part of the experience, contributing to the collective story of colonisation, bearing witness to history and the enduring whispers of the colonised windows that surround them.",

Along the way, they've toured, performed, and recorded with Bret McKenzie, Deva Mahal, AJA, Mā and ONONO.\n\nOver the last year, Little has worked closely with the record producers and multi-instrumentalists Ben Lemi (Vera Ellen, Dawn Diver) and Chris Whethey (Deva Mahal, Holly Arrowsmith) to develop and realise their most significant artistic statement of intent yet.\n\nAn epic work of observation told in five parts, The Nature Project combines the pastoral psychedelia and liminal bedsit intimacy of '60/70s folk music with the contemporaneous cosmic expanses of celestial jazz, as remade through the silicon sensuality of electronic future soul. Through a mixture of songs, poems and ambient interludes, Little will guide the audience through feelings of departure, birth, and the pain of separation, before considering pathways towards reconnection and acceptance through the ciphers of time, love and recognition.\n\nOn the night at the Hannah Playhouse, Little will be joined by Zane Hawkins (bass) Chris Whethey (bass and tracks), Dayle Jellyman (keys), Hikurangi Schaverien-Kaa (drums) and a supporting cast of surprise special guests from across their multiverse.

Good question. Described as having a \"whimsical sense of depressive irony\", she's perpetually observing the psychopathology of everyday life. She loves to help people cackle at this hectic world we live in. She has performed throughout Aotearoa and overseas over the past five years and won Dunedin Comedy's Best Storyteller award in 2021. (She still holds that title, as it's been a long time between Dunedin awards ceremonies.)\n\nIf you've ever felt like your life is being intruded on - physically, emotionally, astrologically or online - this is the show for you.

    "desc": "CAPITAL REEDS is a Wellington-based reed trio comprised primarily of an oboe, a clarinet, and a bassoon. Sometimes we also feature other less familiar reed instruments such as the cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon. The players of CAPITAL REEDS are all connected with each other through the activities of Orchestra Wellington and the RNZAF Symphonic Band.\n\nOur aim is to showcase the reed trio as a distinctive, versatile, and edgy combination of musical instruments by presenting great pieces of music from different and contrasting eras, styles, and genres. Alongside skilfully crafted chamber music works composed specifically for reed trio, we have a variety of artful musical arrangements to share, as well as some original jazz-inspired sonorities. The musicians: Calvin Scott (oboe/cor anglais), Patrick Hayes (clarinet/bass clarinet), Oscar Lavën (bassoon/contrabassoon).",

    "desc": "In 2020, the world began to experience Covid-19.\n\nIn the same year, my mother was diagnosed with depression and subsequently with dementia.\n\nIn the end of December 2021, based on my observations of both my own condition and my mother's illness, I created \"Dance with Dementia\"\n\nAt the end of February 2024, my mother passed away due to kidney failure, returning to heaven. In June 2024, I attended the 12th Atlanta Fringe Festival with my team, carrying a heart of mourning. We performed four shows at the Metropolitan Theatre and ultimately received the Critics' Choice 2024 award.\n\nI hope to continue sharing the creation of \"Dance with Dementia\" with different friends and to further develop the work. As the world faces the phenomenon of an aging population, we or our loved ones may be at risk of developing dementia. I hope more people can more concerts to this illness and the needs of caregivers.",
