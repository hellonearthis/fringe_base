4,"ANTONIO!","""A treasure chest of musical comedy."" ★★★★ West End Best Friend (UK)

What if Shakespeare wasn’t just reusing a character name, but instead was inspired by one proudly queer pirate stealing hearts and booty on the high seas? Antonio takes the stage with his live band ‘The Fools for Love’ to reclaim his stories in this queer punk pirate musical not to be missed. He’s not bitter: he’s getting even!

Now touring Australasia after a ★★★★ and ★★★★★ sell-out season at Edinburgh Fringe 2023, 'Antonio!' is “the cult classic that we all deserve"" Broadway Baby. “This show is such a joy; it’s hilarious, it’s camp” The Edinburgh Reporter ""Vibrant, passionate and extremely fun"" Theatre Travels (UK)

5,"ESSENCE UNFOLDING","WINNER - OUTSTANDING NEWCOMER (INDIVIDUAL) - 2024 Auckland Fringe Awards

""Green works their magic on, over, around, in, and under the hoop. It's impressive work, strong, elegant, lithe, courageous too"".

Step into the enchanting world of 'Essence Unfolding', a circus / contemporary dance fusion, with a smattering of poetry/spoken word created by young creative, Orlando Green.

Come and experience the heartache, the joy and the journey of discovery of a person struggling with identity - but ultimately, the journey of growing into one's self.

 

""From the opening second, ""Essence Unfolding"" is a beautiful, moving, profound and ultimately hopeful piece of work. The narrative that is built from Ollie's movement both in the air and on the floor is completely coherent - from the choreographed stumbles and falls that preface the fall into mental health struggles through the setbacks of recovery, to the grace and clarity of the denouement"" -- Matt Keane, theatreview

""Green is especially impressive when they embed a unique gymnastic flexibility in and around the dance facets of the narrative while never missing a beat of the complex poetic rhythms that anchor the performance in an intense reality."" -- Lexie Matheson, theatreview

14,"CATGPT","CatGPT is the mostly true story of one man's heroic attempts to bring back to life his beloved dead cat Lentil. For Welshman Robin Wealleans the kitty's earthly demise was just the start of version 2.0 and a long quest to reboot his cat with tech and creativity. The unhinged story of how he succeeded against all odds with sophisticated robotics, sensors, complex AI and visuals has to be seen to be believed. After a disasterous freezer mishap, his cat is now back in control, reimagined as L3NT1L and with all the augmented features a cat would love, from laser pointers to a meow synthesiser and minibar. The unlikely duo first hit the catwalk at Edinburgh Fringe in 2024, followed by a sellout interactive UK Xmas tour and recent quirky shows in Tokyo. CatGPT now take their Welsh feline mysteries to the only Welsh bar in the southern hemisphere. L3NT1L and his hapless human tour in an improvised and interactive show with 2.6 million possible permutations, bizarre merchandise and even a comic. Meanwhile the sinister Lentil Industries appears to have a different agenda. Expect a hilarious show about loss, neurodiversity and trying to make sense of it all. Along the way you will learn about cats, determination and the pros and cons of AI.

20,"SOLOVIVOR","In Solovivor, comedian Ralph Hilaga takes on the ultimate improv challenge: a solo Survivor experience with no script, no cast, just his instincts and audience-fuelled characters. Every moment is riskier than the last as he jumps between alliances, rivalries, and blindsides - all on his own. It's an exciting, unpredictable one-man saga where the stakes - and the laughs - are dangerously high.

Solovivor is Ralph's love-letter to reality-TV. After many failed auditions, this is the closest he'll ever get to competing on the real show.




About the Artist

Ralph is an improv, stand up and sketch comedian based in Wellington. Previously a dramatic actor, he transitioned into comedy five years ago and has since trained at the iO theatre in Chicago, The Improv Conspiracy in Melbourne, and Basejump Comedy in Wellington, where he also teaches. He has performed and produced experimental improv and sketch comedy with various groups locally and internationally - such as ""Catfish Trifecta"", ""Wet Soup"", ""Muunboot"", and the chaotic comedy duo ""Mo and Ralph"".","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-06-2024-061156-3921.jpg","Circus Bar","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6094"
21,"THE LAST CRIME","After knocking back a whiskey at the bar, knocking out the chief of police and locking up an avian adversary, a grizzled and melancholic detective finally wipes crime clean from the city. Now he must face his trickiest case yet, what does he do now that he has no crime to solve? Follow Detective Frank Holloway as he navigates a world without peril as you witness what a hero does once his story finishes. Moving on perhaps comes easier to some than others. 

 

The Last Crime is a passion project of style, comedy and maybe even a smidgen of meaning. It was born out of a scene concept in 2023 which, while performed, was brimming with unrealised potential. The original script that inspired The Last Crime was a small parody scene fished from a hidden corner of the internet simply titled 'Film Noir'. It was performed as part of a Theatre Directing course at Victoria University that due to a combination of factors, didn't live up to the imagery and humour envisioned. The Last Crime is a channel through which ideas, goals and visions born of that original scene might finally be realised. 

 

The Last Crime promises to be an engaging and entertaining performance of familiar Film Noir tropes such as the femme fatale, staggering amounts of booze and ominous chalk outlines. While the original Film Noir script was entirely a comedy, The Last Crime introduces an existential weight behind the comical punches of the story. Themes of change, resisting it and the destructive outcome of doing so are prominent features of our play and are just as important as the gags. 

 

Which is dirtier, the city, or the people who call it home? It's your call, come to The Last Crime and find out.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/08-22-2024-133701-8068.jpg","Te Auaha","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6149"

31,"WHISPERS FROM THE COLONISED WINDOWS OF PALESTINE AND AOTEAROA","Colonised Windows of Palestine and Aotearoa is a mini five-day festival featured in the New Zealand Fringe Festival 2025. This unique festival explores the shared struggles of colonisation between Palestine and Aotearoa, using windows as a metaphor for witnessing history and endurance. Each day offers a new perspective, inviting the audience to engage deeply with themes of displacement, resilience, and cultural expression.

The first day features Sameh Shamout's solo performance, Window of Palestine, where poetry, music, and architecture are intricately woven together. Through storytelling, Sameh builds cities from wooden blocks--delicate yet powerful symbols of his people's history. His trembling hands reflect the emotional weight of the narrative, yet the structures stand tall, representing the steadfastness of those he honors. Inevitably, the blocks collapse, mirroring the fragility imposed by colonisation. This visual metaphor poignantly captures the vulnerability of colonised lands and their people.

On the second day, guest poets will take on the role of ""colonised windows,"" each offering a poetic reflection on their experiences with colonisation. Their words act as windows into different stories, opening vistas into the pain, survival, and enduring spirit of cultures across time.

The third day blends Māori and Palestinian voices, as Windows Singing their pain and whispers fills the space with a fusion of traditional songs. These two distant yet connected cultures merge in a powerful expression of grief, resilience, and hope through their respective musical traditions.

On the fourth day, the festival culminates in an interactive, living art performance. The audience becomes part of the experience, contributing to the collective story of colonisation, bearing witness to history and the enduring whispers of the colonised windows that surround them.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-09-2024-060359-4718.jpg","two/fiftyseven","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6209"

33,"CATGPT - UNHINGED","CatGPT is the mostly true story of one man's heroic attempts to bring back to life his beloved dead cat Lentil. For Welshman Robin Wealleans the kitty's earthly demise was just the start of version 2.0 and a long quest to reboot his cat with tech and creativity. The unhinged story of how he succeeded against all odds with sophisticated robotics, sensors, complex AI and visuals has to be seen to be believed. After a disasterous freezer mishap, his cat is now back in control, reimagined as L3NT1L and with all the augmented features a cat would love, from laser pointers to a meow synthesiser and minibar. The unlikely duo first hit the catwalk at Edinburgh Fringe in 2024, followed by a sellout interactive UK Xmas tour and recent quirky shows in Tokyo. CatGPT now take their Welsh feline mysteries to the only Welsh bar in the southern hemisphere. L3NT1L and his hapless human tour in an improvised and interactive show with 2.6 million possible permutations, bizarre merchandise and even a comic.

What do we do when we're stuck in the mud and can't get out?
What if it's our own fault we're stuck?
Is the mud pulling us down, or do we secretly just want to wallow?
Ezra plays with physical theatre, clown and prose to puzzle over how to make meaning from an otherwise chaotic and messy world. Through a unique blend of physical theatre, clown, and prose, the show navigates the fine line between hope, despair, ambition and failure - a glorious mess of exuberance, crushed dreams, and unending frustration.
Stories begin distinct and separate, but as the show progresses and their journeys unfold, the boundaries between them begin to blur. A strange fixation with a mysterious golden liquid draws them all together, weaving a frantic tapestry of intertwined stories with the search for 'substance' at its centre.

""The performance remains engaging and his script is clever, entwining the separate
narratives so they become almost seamless.""

54,"FOR YOU TO KNOW AND ME TO FIND OUT","Following a sold out season that premiered to consecutive standing ovations and critical acclaim in Tamāki Makaurau, multi-disclipinary artist Liv Tennet brings her captivating solo dance narrative to the NZ Fringe Festival. She delves into matrescence, transformation, and the existential quest of one woman grappling with the possibility of having it all...and the question of what ""all"" actually is.

With a sound track as eclectic as her toddler's palate, and drawing on a wide range of dance genres, For You to Know and Me to Find Out explores the all-familiar juggle of the working mother through movement.

Drawing on her own experience of simultaneously trying to keep a small human alive, whilst also keeping her own artistic identity alive, we get a glimpse of the joyous, maddening, exhausting and ultimately fortifying experience of being a ""cool mom"".

Jokes. She's lost her cool.

Tbh she's dropped so many things she's scared of picking them back up.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/08-17-2024-032527-4834.jpg","Te Auaha","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6146"

Meet Amir, Jarred and Mattiu. Together, they take on lunchtime rap battles and spit bars that bring them closer to proving they've got what it takes. But when an unexpected problem arises, the boys must find a way to work together and take on a challenge more significant than themselves. Despite all of these shenanigans, at the heart of this story is a conflict between ego and friendship.

Packed with fresh new beats, Mic Drop is the story of chasing a dream even when all the odds are against you. If you have ever chased a dream or fought to rise above, this show will make you hopeful for the Aro Boys as they Rise, Fall, and Drop the Mic.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-12-2024-103319-2789.jpg","Te Auaha","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6153"

Alongside skilfully crafted chamber music works composed specifically for reed trio, we have a variety of artful musical arrangements to share, as well as some original jazz-inspired sonorities.

67,"BELOW THE WORMS","A feijoa. A witch. A Secret. And two children on a mission at midnight in search of magic. With a hound on their heels and a huhu grub to find the mysteries of the garden unravel before their eyes.

Below the Worms is an absurdist magic realism live work that follows the story of two families that live in homes that sit in the same house above and below each other. The brunt of the story takes place in the front garden that the families share and the audience views the story through the eyes of the two children that belong to the families. The world is full of unexplained magic that slips into the ordinary such as the garden of singing worms and the witch that lives next door with her blood thirsty hound. Despite its terrors and delights the homes live in harmony until a kept secret between the families is revealed and the world is no longer what the children once thought.

Below the Worms is an outdoor theatre experience of physical theatre, puppetry and live music. 

Created by S.L.U.G (Society for Little Ugly Girls) Theatre Company as one of their two debut works in NZ Fringe Festival: Below the Worms and Doormat. S.L.U.G, started by Sarah Lawrence and Sugar Rea-Bruce, aims to create work that makes your heart sing, and that can be both brash and beautiful.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-24-2024-123830-6032.jpg","Welsh Dragon Bar","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6195"

Through a series of humorous anecdotes about her 2 young children and an encounter with an acquaintance, the monologue explores various themes related to motherhood in society.

The new work dives deeper into the challenges and frustrations of parenting, the impact of unsolicited advice, the overwhelming weight of responsibility, along with the conflict between social expectations and individual experience, which hinges on the unrealistic ideal of perfection.

Despite the challenges and frustrations Charlotte faces as a mother, she ultimately celebrates the profound love and joy that come with being a mother. Charlotte's description of the intense bond she shares with her children, her willingness to sacrifice for them, and her ability to find wonder in their everyday experiences demonstrate the deep emotional rewards of motherhood.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/12-10-2024-222414-4624.jpg","Te Auaha","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6166"

This show isn't just about Ravi's journey, but about our shared experience. The performance is accompanied by a personal touch, you are given postcards with the prompt, ""Hey, I just wanted to say..."". As memories are stirred, audiences are encouraged to write down the names of people who have shaped their lives - taking home a tangible reminder to reconnect and share a conversation.

With a fool's brain, a dancer's body and a determination usually reserved only for the truly idiotic, they will attempt to entertain you through any means necessary. How many inventive uses are there for a spoon? Can a clown be a spoon? What actually IS a spoon, really? Does a spork count? Ponder all this and more and you are led through a silly, chaotic, inventive clowning performance designed to lower the effective IQ of every person in the room.

Flawless body, flawless hair, flawless skin, flawless performance, flawless manners, flawless smile... otherwise, who are you?

Flawless is a contemporary circus work about the impossible pursuit to be the perfect woman, which our society has conditioned us to value.

Society places relentless pressure on women to be kind, accommodating, smart, outwardly happy and, of course, attractive... that is perfect.

Flawless uses aerial art, mirrors and movement to explore perfectionism and the stresses and self-criticism that comes with it.

This is a show for those of us who are learning it's okay to be human.

Observation and scrutiny of the body is part of circus accentuating perfectionist tendencies. Flawless instead uses circus to shine a light on perfectionism in the hope of breaking away from it.

Flawless is a debut work by Frankie & Lola (Leanne Jenkins and Frances Muir). Leanne and Frances are the aerial artists from Company Hiraeth's award winning show 'Loops.' Loops was recognized in New Zealand Fringe 2022 with the Grand Design and Melbourne Tour Ready awards.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/11-10-2024-215726-9451.jpg","Te Auaha","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6161"

Birthed from the burnt-out brains of Katie Burson and Georgie Llewellyn, How to Art is a physical theatre-clown-fruit mash-up about making art, surviving, and chasing mass a-peel. Jesters, collectors, and narcissists reign in this low-brow exploration of the cost of creativity and the art of living.

In an industry that values youth, perfection and mass production, can two bruised bananas go the distance? Dripping in desperation, can they find their place before they're put up for sale?

Find out how starving these artists truly are. Watch out, Picasso.

103,"HEY SIRI","Somewhere, someone is dreaming of smashing eggs... someone is scrolling their newsfeed... in Texas a gun owner shoots a barn wall full of bullets... Somewhere a menu is prepared... everywhere molecules reproduce themselves... And a butterfly flaps its wings...

HEY SIRI is a fast paced, rapidly evolving theatre experience which confronts the myth of memory, the manufacture of meaning and the truth of uncertainty. A chaotic world where childhood archetypes, Snapchat filters, live music and metaphysical questions whirl through space and time. Can Siri answer the questions that this wild activity brings up for us? Can anyone?

HEY SIRI is the latest play from multi award-winning playwright Micky Delahunty -- the creator most recently of JIMMY (Fringe 2024) Interrupting Cow (BATS 2023) and #UsTwo (Fringe 2020).

After thirty years off the stage, this is Micky's third acting role in recent times. In HEY SIRI they are joined by granddaughter Lucy, stretching the age range of this five strong cast to between thirteen and seventy-two years. Also onstage will be Jono Weston (JIMMY, Fringe 2024) and Parekawa Finlay (Who Hears the Cries of the Children, Fringe 2023; Hāpaitia, Fringe 2023; JIMMY, Fringe 2024).

Performed by this energised onstage ensemble, HEY SIRI takes a fun flight from the everyday into a world of metaphor, fallacies and illusions.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-10-2024-223918-2163.jpg","Te Auaha","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6165"
104,"JIM'S NO COWBOY","Jim's been wandering the desert for some time, stopping to rest in seedy motels and perform at local dive bars. He's in search of something - what he's unsure. Connection? Identity? Either way, he mustn't stay too long in one place or his past might catch up with him.

 

Sophie Maree presents Jim's No Cowboy, a campy western that plays on the trope of the 'Lone Cowboy' persona whilst exploring what happens when someone spends their life fighting against their true identity. 

Featuring a live band and mix of covers and original music, the play is set over the course of one night in a run-down drag bar; the only sign of life amongst a sea of desert. Jim and his bandmates are set to play their final gig in this small town with plans to head out first thing next morning, however someone from Jim's past appears desparate to reach him before he leaves. If Jim can help it, he'll be far away by then.

110,"THE COMING 2ND","The New Messiah Of Godzone is a self-made failure expert and she's here to take on orthodox religion, the patriarchy and colonisation all in one go with this musical comedy gem!
Jaqi Taimana is an imperfection guru with more than one intergalactic failure story to tell well and sell even weller. It's time to come first for a change!
Taking up the comedy reins again after 21 years of solo-parenting twins, and 13 years of full-time early childhood teaching, Jaqi is now hosting packed-out shows in Raglan, Te Awamutu, Whakatāne, Tauranga, Auckland and Hamilton and was nominated for Best Producer in the 2023 NZ Comedy Guild Awards. This highly engaging hour-long banquet of clever, hilarious songs and lethal stand-up comedy takes a comical, feminist look at first-hand failure and coming second in a success-obsessed world.

112,"THE SELF POSSESSED","The Castrato and The Countertenor: A Spicy Seance.
Two very queer voices, two very eccentric existences. 18th century European opera superstar, Gaetano Guardagni duets across 275 years with obscure 21st century Antipodean performance artist Glenn McKenzie.


Italian born, castrated at nine, nurtured in England by the composer Handel and the actor/producer Garrick, Gae was celebrated for his emotive performances of the great men and women of mythology. Most famous for his creation of Orpheus for Gluck's genre changing 1762 opera, his life was one of delirious adulation, delightful adventure, and delicious allegation!
Never at home, never belonging, always the 'other', Gae and Glenn have spent their public and private existences dancing along the razor edge of conventional society's prescription of class and gender. Now they playfully explore their lives' performance, both on and off stage, as they search out some authentic sense of self through a period-incorrect muddle of music and musings. They chat about vocation, compare experiences, and share songs against a kaleidoscope of evocative projections, hoping to discover what makes a man.

Music by Gluck, Handel, Puccini, Purcell, Schubert, Vaughan-Williams, Noel Coward, Gilbert & Sullivan, and Billie Eilish. Projections by Japanese/Australian contemporary artist Junko Hagiwara, production by Emma Maguire

Glenn McKenzie is a neurodiverse queer Kiwi actor, musician and writer based in Sydney: their work explores the hidden drives and desires of contemporary society, through a unique blend of theatrical and musical skills.

Fresh from a minor scandal at Auckland Fringe in 2024, and with a few other shows in between, we feel we've nailed the delicate balance of good taste we know Wellington requires.

Every Fother Muckers show is completely different as you, the audience, help our human host decide the questions the Fother Muckers puppets will answer on the night. So, really, the show is a felt-based reflection of your own dreams and desires isn't it...

So bring a friend or two and the Fother Muckers will help solve some of your most pressing problems, bring your mum for that overdue catch up, or bring a first date and we'll help steer you both on the path to everlasting happiness*.

WARNING: The Fother Muckers is unscripted and, technically, an R18 show. Neither the Host nor the puppets are responsible for your hurt feelings, but remain willing to milk your schadenfreude as much as possible in the pursuit of theatrical excellence. Your guilty feelings are yours.

122,"IRIS LITTLE - THE NATURE PROJECT","After setting the stage alight at the Silver Scrolls, Te Whanganui-a-Tara, singer-songwriter and storyteller Iris Little is ready to share a new interlinked cycle of songs and poems that ask us to reconsider our relationship with, and disconnection from, the natural world.

Regarded as one of the leading lights in the capital's refreshed young indie folk, jazz, and neo-soul scenes, Little's spellbinding stage presence, magnetism, and distinct, emotionally honest voice has won over audiences around the motu, North America and Europe. Along the way, they've toured, performed, and recorded with Bret McKenzie, Deva Mahal, AJA, Mā and ONONO.

Over the last year, Little has worked closely with the record producers and multi-instrumentalists Ben Lemi (Vera Ellen, Dawn Diver) and Chris Whethey (Deva Mahal, Holly Arrowsmith) to develop and realise their most significant artistic statement of intent yet.

An epic work of observation told in five parts, The Nature Project combines the pastoral psychedelia and liminal bedsit intimacy of '60/70s folk music with the contemporaneous cosmic expanses of celestial jazz, as remade through the silicon sensuality of electronic future soul. Through a mixture of songs, poems and ambient interludes, Little will guide the audience through feelings of departure, birth, and the pain of separation, before considering pathways towards reconnection and acceptance through the ciphers of time, love and recognition.

On the night at the Hannah Playhouse, Little will be joined by Zane Hawkins (bass) Chris Whethey (bass and tracks), Dayle Jellyman (keys), Hikurangi Schaverien-Kaa (drums) and a supporting cast of surprise special guests from across their multiverse. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to be present as Little and their band open the portal and walk between states of being while performing this milestone work.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-22-2024-235533-8631.jpg","Hannah Playhouse","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6115"

With electric lip-syncs, quick wit, and palpable tension, this show is not one to be missed!","https://eventotron.imgix.net/09-30-2024-063632-4815.jpg","BATS Theatre","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6069"

141,"EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AT NUMBER 68","Sharehouses come and go, but some of them stay with us forever; whether we like it or not. Number 68 was one of those houses.

A stellar 2024 international tour saw Nick Robertson break out onto the Festival scene with their debut solo show 'Leave To Enter', selling out shows across Australia and New Zealand, garnering critical acclaim and award nominations. This year he returns with 'Everything That Happened at Number 68', an hour of captivating and hilarious storytelling about terrible landlords, DJ flatmates and unwanted 3am bedroom guests.

'Everything That Happened at Number 68' is a show about a house and the people that lived in it - but mostly it's a story about stories, as Nick deciphers where one story ends and another begins. It's also a story about a rabbit named Meataxe and a guy Nick is pretty sure is a Russian spy.

Come watch this 'exquisite storyteller' (The Age) weave together stories in a tale that will stay with you longer than any lease you've had.

142,"HAUSDOWN","The C**tiest Queer Regency Farce!

It is common knowledge among the ton that those invited to summer at the country estate of HAUSDOWN will encounter a season of honeyed hospitality, diverting company, and queer delights.

Siblings and hosts, Lord Edwin Hausdown and Lady Louisa Hausdown, have this year invited several of their most beloved, amusing, (and eligible) companions to take the COUNTRY AIR! On the guestlist are their cousins, Lord Edward Lapthorn and Captain August Lapthorn, the Duke and Dukess of Cuntcliffe; Louisa's childhood friend Lady Beatrice Swoonsworth, Baroness of Delusiomont, whose many engagements usually keep her from attending; and finally the untitled, but nonetheless well-connected, Harriet and Susan Girthshire. This party finds itself in a comedy of bemuddled hearts.

Will the country air be enough to untangle these lovelorn gentlefolk?

Titled HAUSDOWN in reference to the queer cultural adage, Inconceivable Productions presents their sell-out queer regency farce by Katie Hill & Ruby Carter. HAUSDOWN is a 60-minute joyful comedic reclamation of beloved Regency stories aimed to bring representation and entertainment for the emerging queer generation, and established fanbase. HAUSDOWN is an ridiculously opulent display of polite society, companionship, and unbridled lust.

143,"LOVE; MUM","Sela Faletolu-Fasi created 'Love; Mum' in 2023, from a goodbye letter she wrote to her 6 children. She knew they would never thank her for that letter, so she decided to write a play as a way of sharing her story, expressing hope and to let her children know they are the reason for everything. All five characters in 'Love; Mum' are a representation of her and the struggles she has faced in life and as a Mum.

Love; Mum is about 5 Pacific women who meet at 'Mums Anonymous' - a self-help group for new Mums. They form a sisterhood that embarks on the journey of parenting together and the struggles we don't often talk about.


As their children get older, life gets more complicated and begins to test their relationship with each other and the people they love. For Joy, the struggle to show up for the sisterhood while trying to navigate her own life becomes unbearable.


This is a funny and yet heartbreaking story about motherhood, about women, and ultimately about the power of love and forgiveness to overcome it all.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-16-2024-215622-9356.jpg","BATS Theatre","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6077"

145,"CALLUM AND HOANI OPEN A CAN OF WHOOP-LAUGHS","Kick your chuckle bucket with two of Aotearoa's favourite new comedic black belts.

2025 Billy T Nominee Hoani Hotene, and the Hāwera Gremlin Callum Wagstaff, team up to take Wellington all. The way. Down. Town.

The breakdown:
Over the course of an hour, Callum and Hoani will combine forces in a tag-team format, mainly working the body and face.

Hoani is known for his endearing, quirky energy and fast-paced combination right hook of observation and left jab of absurdity. He draws from his upbringing in a Māori language school, and in the past has covered pillow talk, playing his favourite song and Māori Spongebob Squarepants. As well as his championship belt in the 2022 NZ Raw Comedy Quest competition, he also brings to the ring the NZ Comedy Guild Breakthrough Comedian Award two years in a row (2022, 2023) and Best Joke in the Wellington Comedy Awards (2022).

Callum likes to move and he likes to keep low to the ground. He'll no doubt be employing the """"gremlin style"""" he's made his own, grappling with surreal visuals and a touch of spookiness. His background is growing up in Starship Children's Hospital and he's been known to cover that, as well as bugs and ghosts.
His past fights have been close calls, coming second to Hoani in that Raw Quest competition, as well as every comedy guild award he's ever been nominated for. But he has twice picked up a Best Comedian award from Comedy Hub (2022, 2023), as well as a Best Comedian nomination from Nelson Fringe Festival (2024).

There's no doubt about it, these guys are going to take to the ring armed with nothing but their mics, their wits, and the occasional prop - but they are going to leave it all out on the stage for you, the bloodthirsty chuckle-seeker.

Dictionary is an orignial NZ absurdist work by Nathan King that follows two personified linguistic theories, Pre(scriptivism) and Dee(scriptivism), as they compete, argue, squabble, and get incomprehensibly lost in semasiological semantics.

When we say this is, ""Theatre Of The Absurd,"" we mean it - only a madman is going to be able to decipher these two.

You're in for a wheelbarrow of wordplay, pacey dialogue, absurdism, cognitive linguistics, and the questioning of the metaethics of hot dogs. We can't guarantee that you're going to learn anything; but you will be entertained, and you will come out thinking, ""What just happened?""

An Exquisite Dance of Control and Release

Step into a world where gravity bends and the boundaries of the human body are pushed to their limits. Temporal Aria is an evocative contemporary circus show that blends the ancient art of hair suspension with acrobatics, handstands, and contortion to explore the delicate balance between control and release.

Through breathtaking feats of strength and grace, the performer navigates the tension between being bound and free, both physically and emotionally. Suspended by her hair, she defies gravity, embodying vulnerability and resilience. Each act unfolds as a poetic expression of the human relationship with control--how we hold on, let go, and ultimately find balance.

Set against a mesmerizing soundscape, Temporal Aria invites audiences to witness the fluid intersection of art and acrobatics, where every movement is a testament to the performer's mastery over body and mind.

Who is Nicola? Good question. Described as having a ""whimsical sense of depressive irony"", she's perpetually observing the psychopathology of everyday life. She loves to help people cackle at this hectic world we live in. She has performed throughout Aotearoa and overseas over the past five years and won Dunedin Comedy's Best Storyteller award in 2021.

As straight, white, male comedians the world over either crash and burn complaining about equality and wokeness or perform stunning handbrake turns pretending they were never part of the problem, loser comedian, Simon Kingsley-Holmes, has decided to own up. Coming from a conservative background, he has slowly realised that the views he grew up with and loudly espoused were wrong and now seems ample time to rip the piss out of his past self.
From attempting to solve the Northern Ireland question aged seven to defending racist terms as a teenager in multicultural New Zealand, Simon has done it all with the kind of lack of self-awareness that only a true comedian could muster. If you want the satisfaction of hearing an Englishman admit that you were right or if you just want to laugh at a complete prat then welcome, friend... I'm here for you!

Trigger warning: incase you hadn't guessed it, this show does indeed contain racist language in order to illustrate an anti-racism argument. And I'm not adding anything further because I feel that, somewhow or other, I'd write the wrong thing.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-13-2024-132435-8612.jpg","Sweet Axe Throwing Co.","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6139"

166,"PROWL","Birthing realms. Portals to the other. We are neither noun nor adjective. Indulge in the intimacy of divinity. Feminine beauty wrapped in a dagger. A mother of many things. He is feminine seduction. She is feminine rage. They are feminine sisterhood. Prowl delves into the ever evolving world of femininity through the dynamic realm of street dance theatre. Drawing on the divine feminine as a chameleon, witness urban POC artists take the stage, delving into the complex layers of femininity within themselves and one another. Utilising street dance as a potent tool for political expression, these performers confront gender and body politics, challenging colonial legacies and spotlighting indigenous perspectives on gender and femininity, dismantling and redefining the concepts shaped by colonialism. Explore the shadings of femininity as Prowl world builds across the spectrum of our feminine existence. Portal. Celestial. Allure. Seduce. Rage. Danger. Fellowship. Safety. Prowl is femininity as an experience, through street dance, spoken word, and song. It challenges traditional notions and highlights what is, what we are, and what we reject. The complexities of femininity. PROWL, PROTECT & STAND.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/11-19-2024-014418-6448.jpg","Gryphon Theatre","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6096"

In the same year, my mother was diagnosed with depression and subsequently with dementia.

In the end of December 2021, based on my observations of both my own condition and my mother's illness, I created ""Dance with Dementia""

At the end of February 2024, my mother passed away due to kidney failure, returning to heaven. In June 2024, I attended the 12th Atlanta Fringe Festival with my team, carrying a heart of mourning. We performed four shows at the Metropolitan Theatre and ultimately received the Critics' Choice 2024 award.

I hope to continue sharing the creation of ""Dance with Dementia"" with different friends and to further develop the work. As the world faces the phenomenon of an aging population, we or our loved ones may be at risk of developing dementia. I hope more people can more concerts to this illness and the needs of caregivers.","https://eventotron.imgix.net/10-06-2024-105609-7540.jpg","Vogelmorn Bowling Club","https://tickets.fringe.co.nz/event/446:6200"
